In fact，he had difficulty reading and writing. When important papers came to Jackson，he tried to read them and then had his assistants explain what they said. If he approved of a paper. he would write ‘all correct’ on it. The problem was that he didn’t know how to spell. So what he really wrote was ‘ol korekt’ .After a while，he shortened that term to “OK”.<br />　　The second explanation is based on the place where President Van Buren was born，Kinderhook，New York. Van Bnren’s friends organized a club to help him become President They caned the club the Old Kinderhook Club，and anyone who supported Van Buren was called ‘OK’."

We don’t know if either story is true，but they are both interesting. The first explanation is based on the fact that President Jackson had very little education. In fact，he had difficulty reading and writing. When important papers came to Jackson，he tried to read them and then had his assistants explain what they said. If he approved of a paper. he would write ‘all correct’ on it. The problem was that he didn’t know how to spell. So what he really wrote was ‘ol korekt’ .After a while，he shortened that term to “OK”.<br/>　　The second explanation is based on the place where President Van Buren was born，Kinderhook，New York. Van Bnren’s friends organized a club to help him become President They caned the club the Old Kinderhook Club，and anyone who supported Van Buren was called ‘OK’."

						"questionTitle":"There are stories about two U.S. presidents，Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren，which attempt to explain the American English term OK. We don’t know if either story is true，but they are both interesting. The first explanation is based on the fact that President Jackson had very little education. In fact，he had difficulty reading and writing. When important papers came to Jackson，he tried to read them and then had his assistants explain what they said. If he approved of a paper. he would write ‘all correct’ on it. The problem was that he didn’t know how to spell. So what he really wrote was ‘ol korekt’ .After a while，he shortened that term to “OK”.\n　　The second explanation is based on the place where President Van Buren was born，Kinderhook，New York. Van Bnren’s friends organized a club to help him become President They caned the club the Old Kinderhook Club，and anyone who supported Van Buren was called ‘OK’.",

								"text":"Five Things Nobody Told Me about College As I type this , I am in my university dorm room. A year ago, when I was awaiting to hear the results of my college applications, I often went to websites for some type of insider look on what college would be like. However, there’s only so much that prep books, websites, and older friends can teach. Here are the top 5things nobody told me about college:<br/>(__1__)<br/>Nobody entering a university knows exactly what they want to study. If they tell you otherwise, they’re lying and will probably change what they want to purse within the first quarter of attendance . During my first quarter at University of California, Riverside (UCR),I thought that I wanted to study Political Science with its focus on International Affairs, so that’s what I applied for. However, once I worked with statewide and local government, I realized that a better fit for me would be Public Policy, and now I am in the process of changing my area.<br/>(__2__)<br/>In college, there are so many good chances for you to meet your expectations. However, there is a very important difference between wanting to do something and applying for something. In order for you to take advantage of the conferences, research, internships , and fellowships that your university offers, apply! Step into your academic advisor’s office, introduce yourself, and begin making the valuable connections that are necessary to help during the rest of your college career. Great things happen when you step out of your comfort zone, and you would be surprised on how many chances exist if you just ask.<br/>(__3__)<br/>College is where you meet your birdesmaids, neighbors, and potential bosses. The relationships you develop now will probably be linked to the ones you value later, so he wise about the people who you invest yourself in . You are only one person, and you do not have time to waste on people who would rather cause drama or mess up with your purpose. Surround yourself with uplifting individuals who challenge you to be better while loving you for who you are, and be patient to the people who are the complete opposite of that description.<br/>(__4__)<br/>As a first-year, I was afraid to make any noise towards campus issues that I noticed. It was not until I became involved in student government that I gained the confidence to handle projects that I created with the help of ASUCR Office of the President. During my first quarter, I spoke directly to the Chancellor, asking him for support towards my initiavives, met with the Vive Chancellors, and coorerated with my teaching assistances to begin my undergraduate research protect. Nothing good will happen when you are silent.<br/>(__5__)<br/>At my high school,there were about only four active club and organizations that students could be a part of.Imagine my surprise when I stepped foot onto UCR’s capus,where over 400 organizations exist,ranging from political organizations to karate club.You are not paying all or your tuition(学费)to merely go to class,study,pass tests and graduate.Make something worthy out of your experience.Create that you will want to tell your grandchildren one day.It all begins here,by signing up to join an organization."

						"questionTitle":"Five Things Nobody Told Me about College As I type this , I am in my university dorm room. A year ago, when I was awaiting to hear the results of my college applications, I often went to websites for some type of insider look on what college would be like. However, there’s only so much that prep books, websites, and older friends can teach. Here are the top 5things nobody told me about college:\n(__1__)\nNobody entering a university knows exactly what they want to study. If they tell you otherwise, they’re lying and will probably change what they want to purse within the first quarter of attendance . During my first quarter at University of California, Riverside (UCR),I thought that I wanted to study Political Science with its focus on International Affairs, so that’s what I applied for. However, once I worked with statewide and local government, I realized that a better fit for me would be Public Policy, and now I am in the process of changing my area.\n(__2__)\nIn college, there are so many good chances for you to meet your expectations. However, there is a very important difference between wanting to do something and applying for something. In order for you to take advantage of the conferences, research, internships , and fellowships that your university offers, apply! Step into your academic advisor’s office, introduce yourself, and begin making the valuable connections that are necessary to help during the rest of your college career. Great things happen when you step out of your comfort zone, and you would be surprised on how many chances exist if you just ask.\n(__3__)\nCollege is where you meet your birdesmaids, neighbors, and potential bosses. The relationships you develop now will probably be linked to the ones you value later, so he wise about the people who you invest yourself in . You are only one person, and you do not have time to waste on people who would rather cause drama or mess up with your purpose. Surround yourself with uplifting individuals who challenge you to be better while loving you for who you are, and be patient to the people who are the complete opposite of that description.\n(__4__)\nAs a first-year, I was afraid to make any noise towards campus issues that I noticed. It was not until I became involved in student government that I gained the confidence to handle projects that I created with the help of ASUCR Office of the President. During my first quarter, I spoke directly to the Chancellor, asking him for support towards my initiavives, met with the Vive Chancellors, and coorerated with my teaching assistances to begin my undergraduate research protect. Nothing good will happen when you are silent.\n(__5__)\nAt my high school,there were about only four active club and organizations that students could be a part of.Imagine my surprise when I stepped foot onto UCR’s capus,where over 400 organizations exist,ranging from political organizations to karate club.You are not paying all or your tuition(学费)to merely go to class,study,pass tests and graduate.Make something worthy out of your experience.Create that you will want to tell your grandchildren one day.It all begins here,by signing up to join an organization.",
